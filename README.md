Assets import
-
With this tool you can import your files with a simple drag and drop on the application or by selecting them in your folders.
You can also import your textures from clipboard, simple as a copy and paste!

Technically, this tool converts the textures in an understandable format for the Resource Compiler and opens the CryTif interface without Photoshop or any additional software.
For meshes, the files are directly sent to the Resource Compiler so they share the same limitations. That works great for static meshes in fbx.

The Resource Compiler used is the one defined by the Crytek's Settings Manager tool.

By default, the files are stored in the same directory than the input file. However, you can set a custom output folder affecting all the imported files!
For the textures provided by the clipboard, a dialog box lets you choose the filename and the output folder.

Custom links
-
Not exactly related to the asset pipeline, this tool also allows you to define up to six links available directly in the interface.

For each link, you can define its title, its target path and some command line arguments.
This links can be used to open or execute every files, folders and web pages!
Also, you can use the [SDK_FOLDER] variable for retrieve the SDK path defined by the Crytek's Settings Manager.
